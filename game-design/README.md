# Game Development Hobby

For the past few years I spent some time working with Blender and Unreal Engine developing a lot of skills I felt were important to me, and I decided to post some of my "work" in game development and design here as well. I have been asked a couple of times to help people with their game, but they never paid me and the projects disappeared. Still, some of that work will appear here too...though nothing mindblowing that's for sure.

I have 2 other repos dedicated to Unreal Engine. My aim was not to design a game, but to provide resources people can learn from. I watched a LOT of tutorials and tried to find the best ones.

* [Developing in Unreal Engine](https://github.com/rickhenderson/developing-in-unreal-engine) - My original repo started with UE 5.2 when it was released. I think I started on 5.1.
* [Game Development and Design](https://github.com/rickhenderson/game-development-and-design) - This repo focussed more on higher level elements of game design such as design documents, starting by modding an existing game, level design basics, etc.
  * I was helping out in the Gorka Games discord when he started the RPG tutorial series and had under 10K followers! :)


## Interesting Updates

* June 12, 2025: Started working in Unreal Engine again after a break, with UE 5.6. I've forgotten so much! :(
* June 15, 2025: Started a new project with the Game Animation Sample and adding a [health and damage system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3uFXnNxwKE&ab_channel=AliElzoheiry) from Ali Elzoheiry because he illustrates reusable and flexible design principles including interfaces. However it would be nice if he included these in plug-ins but I'll perhaps get into that later.
  * I have an earlier project using the Lyra project, adding a custom level and a custom weapon I will add information about sometime - that used plug-ins.
* I had UE videos posted on my Youtube channel in 2023-24 and the channel was deleted so I will find some more to upload.
* I have also taken part in 2 challenges and my entry made it into one of the final cuts but didn't place.
* I have 1 game I made in a hack-a-thon posted on a popular free game site but I'm currently too embarrased to post it here because the final version is broken. I may add video clips.
