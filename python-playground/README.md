I created wrote this code as a way to beef up my Python skills.

The main impetus was for a job interview with Google as a Security Engineer. Some of the examples are based on a previous interview I had with SunLife, 
and others are based on suggestions from Grace Nolan's repo: [https://github.com/gracenolan/Notes/blob/master/interview-study-notes-for-security-engineering.md](https://github.com/gracenolan/Notes/blob/master/interview-study-notes-for-security-engineering.md).
