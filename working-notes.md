# Unsorted Working Notes

In this file I'm tracking the kinds of things I do that apply to new projects or general research.

## May 2025

**May 28, 2025:** I applied for a job that mentioned requiring knowledge of botnets and botnet infrastructure. After first thinking of [Sliver](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver) and [Havoc](https://github.com/HavocFramework/Havoc) which are both command and control (C2) frameworks, I did a search for `botnet frameworks` and the first hit is the open botnet framework called [BYOB - Bring Your Own Botnet](https://github.com/malwaredllc/byob).

BYOB is an open botnet framework designed for education purposes, but is fully functional. I first encountered it during an investigation involving bots, when I was reading a threat intelligence article from some researcher that included a particular portion of code that looked unusual. This was when I began checking Github for unique code fragments and this particular fragment turned up in BYOB. This "educational tool" had been successfully used in an attack. Alas, memory fails me now - 2 years later - to remember what case. Though maybe I have notes about it somewhere. At that time I had cloned the repo and got it working to test out some of the bot agents.

So I cloned BYOB to re-familiarize myself with it in case it comes up in the interview.
