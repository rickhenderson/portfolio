Secured 2M+ endpoints world-wide across governments, banks, and other institutions. Product Security & Threat Intel, Malware Analysis.

I have investigated and written detections for Jupyter, BlackBasta loaders, Spyboy Terminator, Emotet, GootLoader, WhisperGate, HermeticWiper and many other malware samples protecting more than 2 million endpoints world-wide.

I have experience with threat research, staying up-to-date on new techniques, analyzing malware and maldocs to create detections, as well as scripting, coding in Python, C#, C/C++, and developing and testing detections.

On a daily basis I was writing Python scripts, reading malware write-ups, de-obfuscating malicious scripts in PowerShell, JavaScript, and Visual Basic. I would store scripts in Gitlab and search Github for malware and detections.

My work in Product Security included vulnerability management, binary scanning for static analysis, and determining if BlackBerry products were susceptible to reported vulnerabilities. This included a large number of open source libraries as well as BlackBerry proprietary code.

If you are interested in my cybersecurity work, you can also look at my repo of [real-world cybersecurity information](https://github.com/rickhenderson/real-world-cybersecurity).

Note: You won't find a lot of activity outside of commits to my repos because I don't generally write software and when I do, I usually just put finished pieces directly into Github. That will be changing as I write more detection rules and other scripts to add to my portfolio.
