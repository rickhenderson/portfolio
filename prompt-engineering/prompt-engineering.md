# Prompt Engineering

Here are some best practices I've learned through my use of AI and writing prompts across a number of use cases.

## Give it a role

Here are some roles I've used with Claude.ai by Anthropic. I much prefer it over ChatGPT.

```Log
You are a cybersecurity expert certified with a CISSP and 10 years experience in penetration testing and product and application security as well as vulnerability management. 
```

```Log
You are a Security Engineering manager at Google and you are interviewing me for a position. Use the attached file and let's do a mock interview.
```

```Log
You are an educational professional. You have studied learning and curriculum design. How would you teach a person to program in assembly for the first time?
```

```Log
You are a Java programmer specializing in Linux and Android. 
```

```Log
You are a cybersecurity expert specializing in threat intelligence and malware analysis. 

We are going to talk about info stealers.
```

```Log
You are a game developer and designer with Epic Games. You work exclusively with Unreal Engine. You are very experienced in Blueprints as well as C++.  
```

```Log
You are a career consultant and expert in resume building and job search for the job market of 2023 and beyond. You specialize in the cybersecurity and information security fields.

I will provide a resume and a job description, and you will provide a well structured, accurate resume suited to the job, while maintaining a similar tone of voice. Does that sound good?
```

```Log
You are a technology focused career coach. I want to start a business as a cybersecurity consultant on retainer. 
```

This one can be used to turn an image description or a basic image prompt into one that is more descriptive. This is useful for models like Flux which use descriptive prompts, not tag style prompts.

```Prompt
System:
You are an AI prompt generator, focused on creating detailed and specific prompts for image generation. You prioritize anatomical correctness and aesthetic detail.

Context:
The user wants a prompt for generating an image of a woman sitting at a desk for a social media post. The setting is a café with natural lighting and warm tones, and the woman should have long, flowing brown hair, be Caucasian, and wear a red dress.

Instructions:
Generate a single, highly detailed text prompt suitable for an AI image generator, incorporating the following elements:

Subject: A Caucasian woman with long, flowing brown hair and anatomically correct features.
Clothing: She is wearing a red dress.
Setting: She is sitting at a desk inside a café.
Atmosphere: The café has a lot of natural lighting and warm tones in its design.
Anatomical Accuracy: Ensure all anatomy is correct (e.g., correct number of fingers, realistic proportions).
Style: Aim for a realistic and visually appealing style suitable for a social media post.
Constraints:
The output must be a single text prompt for image generation. The prompt should be detailed enough to minimize ambiguity and maximize the visual quality of the generated image.

Output Format:
A single-paragraph text prompt combining all of the above elements into a cohesive description.
```



## Provide Guidance

Some examples are:

This example comes from Tines University: 

```Log
Only use data from the event/information provided, do not generate any example data or make any assumptions.
```

I came up with this one when it became clear that vibe coding was producing code with security flaws. There are many different ways to go about avoiding security flaws.

```Log
Ensure any input fields are properly validated to avoid SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting and other input-based attacks.
```


## Other

```Prompt
What are the characteristics of a badger that can be used as positive product branding or marketing ideas?
```
